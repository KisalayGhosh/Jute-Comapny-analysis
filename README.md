An analysis of Sales, Gross Profit and Inventory data of a Private Jute Manufacturing Company based on real data collected from site. The Business is a Jute manufacturer and exporter. The analysis was done on monthly sales and production data and monthly stock data for the period from July 2021 to December 2021. Month wise volume analysis and sales analysis was done; Ranking of products along with recommendations and observations to improve profit was done.

Recommendations:
Since the company currently has a global presence,and almost has a monopoly in India, the company can control the Jute market with new specialized products and can alter its prices freely without the fear of any serious competition.
•Given the demand for Jute fiber in recent years because of adaptation of biodegradable products competing with cotton fibers, the Company can expand into newer regions without incurring a substantial production cost. 
•Since the prices of common products ( Jute and Bamboo Net (6 Pack)& Jute sugar bags (5 pack) ) are at par with its competitors, it has some room for increasing their unit prices so that they can give a positive gross profit so as to balance the cost of production volume to its sales volume.
•Sales and production of Colourful Jute Ribbon (10 meter) should be minimized to a particular requirement so as to minimize the company’s losses.
•Sales of Jute Hessian Wine Bag (2 Pack) can be increased by a limited amount given that it the the most profitable product of the company but not so much as to lose its specialized status in the market. Unit price for Jute Hessian Wine Bag (2 Pack) can also be increased by a certain amount so as to maximize profits but not so much as to drive customers to direct competitors.
